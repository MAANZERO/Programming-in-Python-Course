## Course Overview

This course introduces students to the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python. It covers Python basics, control structures, functions, data structures, and gradually progresses to OOP concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exception handling.

## Week-by-Week Plan

1. **Week 1 (Introduction to Python):**
   - Installing necessary tools (VS-code, Python interpreter).
   - Overview and history of Python.
   - Setting up the development environment.

2. **Week 2 (Basics of Python):**
   - Variables and data types in Python.
   - Basic operators and expressions.
   - Printing output to the screen.

3. **Week 3 (Python Program Execution):**
   - Understanding how Python programs run.
   - Problem-solving approach and logical thinking in Python.

4. **Week 4 (Control Flow):**
   - Conditional statements (if-else) in Python.
   - Looping structures (for and while loops).
   - Flow control and decision-making in programs.

5. **Week 5 (Functions and Modules):**
   - Functions in Python: defining functions, local and global scope.
   - Working with modules and libraries in Python.

6. **Week 6 (Data Structures):**
   - Introduction to data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
   - Operations and use cases for different data structures.

7. **Week 7 (Introduction to OOP):**
   - Basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

    - Implementing inheritance in Python.

11. **Week 11 (Polymorphism):**
    - Polymorphism and dynamic binding.
    - Method overriding and method overloading.

12. **Week 12 (Abstraction):**
    - Abstraction and abstract classes.
    - Implementing abstract classes in Python.

13. **Week 13 (Exception Handling):**
    - Handling exceptions and errors in Python.
    - Using try, except, and finally blocks.

14. **Week 14 (Unit Testing):**
    - Discussion of Unit Testing in software project development.

15. **Week 15 (Functional Programming):**
    - Python Lambda functions, decorators, generators, zip, map, reduce. 
    - Reviewing key concepts and topics from the course.
